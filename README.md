[let's share books]
===================

The easiest way to share your book catalog is to run Calibre's content server (help: http://bit.ly111IWwt) and let people access your laptop/desktop computer. If you have a server with public URL and know how to set up reverse ssh port forwarding you are probably already doing that. Great. If not, here is the solution:
 0. run Calibre's content server (help: http://bit.ly111IWwt) 
 1. if you run GNU/Linux or OSX download letssharebooks.sh
 2. open the terminal and change directory where you downloaded letssharebooks.sh
 3. run it:

    sh letssharebooks.sh

 4. wait for the output like this:

    Check if you started Calibre's content server:
    http://localhost:8080 (help: http://bit.ly111IWwt)
    Hang out at http://crypto.cat room: letssharebooks
    Stop sharing books by pressing Ctrl+c
    Your temporary public URL is http://www56581.memoryoftheworld.org

 5. copy your public URL (e.g. http://www56581.memoryoftheworld.org) and share it with your friends
