Over time Paul Otlet became a collector\u00a0of documents, any kind of document, from the book to the image. He had\u00a0become persuaded that the dissemination of knowledge will lead to universal\u00a0peace. Henri La Fontaine\u2019s was a political life. He received the Nobel Peace\u00a0Prize in 1913.

At the same time it was one of the most influential theoretical works for a wide range of political and revolutionary practice in the 1960s. Today, Debord's work continues to be in the forefront of debates about the fate of consumer society and the operation of modern social power. In a sweeping revision of Marxist categories, the notion of the spectacle takes the problem of the commodity from the sphere of economics to a point at which the commodity as an image dominates not only economic exchange but the primary communicative and symbolic activity of all modern societies.Guy Debord was one of the most important participants in the activities associated with the Situationist International in the 1960s.

Now he is widely held to have possessed one of the most acute and original minds of the Central European culture decimated by the Nazis. Illuminations contains his two most celebrated essays, 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction' and 'Theses on the Philosophy of History', as well as others on the art of translation, Kafka, storytelling, Baudelaire, Brecht's epic theatre, Proust and an anatomy of his own obsession, book collecting. The essay is Benjamin's domain; those collected in this now legendary volume offer the best possible access to his singular and significant achievement. In a stimulating introduction, Hannah Arendt reveals how Benjamin's life and work are a prism to his times, and identifies him as possessing the rare ability to think poetically. </p><h3>Language Notes</h3><p>Text: English, German (translation) </p></div>", "languages": ["eng"], "cover_data": [null, null], "toc": null, "thumbnail": null, "db_id": null, "tags": ["Library"], "timestamp": "2013-07-22 20:14:26+00:00", "last_modified": "2014-02-24 04:32:18+00:00", "mime": null, "authors": ["Walter Benjamin"], "format_metadata": {"EPUB": {"path": "/home/m/devel/letssharebooks/mock2_calibre_library/Walter Benjamin/Illuminations (45)/Illuminations - Walter Benjamin.epub", "size": 1026201, "mtime": "2014-02-24 04:32:18.356793+00:00"}}, "publisher": "Schocken", "series_index": null, "lpath": null, "user_categories": {}, "spine": null, "title_sort": "Illuminations", "cover": null, "book_producer": null, "manifest": null, "formats": ["EPUB"], "guide": null, "device_collections": [], "identifiers": {"barnesnoble": "w/illuminations-walter-benjamin/1100623658", "google": "AFJ7dvSdXPgC", "isbn": "9780805202410", "amazon": "0805202412"}}, {"rating": null, "author_sort": "Bruce, Lorne", "application_id": 46, "pubdate": "1994-01-08 23:00:00+00:00", "series": null, "author_sort_map": {"Lorne Bruce": "Bruce, Lorne"}, "librarian": "Jacqu3s Crosw3ll", "publication_type": null, "size": null, "author_link_map": {"Lorne Bruce": ""}, "rights": null, "uuid": "07786ee9-93a7-4414-9c12-c5fc639a0335", "title": "Free Books for All: The Public Library Movement in Ontario, 1850-1930", "comments": "<div><p><em>Free Books for All</em> provides a detailed and reflective account of the people. groups, communities, and ideas that shaped library development in the decades between 1850 and 1930, from Egerton Ryerson to George Locke, from Mechanics Institutes to renovated Carnegie libraries.

To the bureaucrat, archives contain little more than garbage, paperwork no longer needed; to the historian, on the other hand, the archive's content stands as a quasi-objective correlative of the \"living\" past. Twentieth-century art made use of the archive in a variety of ways--from what Spieker calls Marcel Duchamp's \"anemic archive\" of readymades and El Lissitzky's Demonstration Rooms to the compilations of photographs made by such postwar artists as Susan Hiller and Gerhard Richter. In The Big Archive, Sven Spieker investigates the archive--as both bureaucratic institution and index of evolving attitudes toward contingent time in science and art--and finds it to be a crucible of twentieth-century modernism. Dadaists, constructivists, and Surrealists favored discontinuous, nonlinear archives that resisted hermeneutic reading and ordered presentation. Spieker argues that the use of archives by such contemporary artists as Hiller, Richter, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Walid Raad, and Boris Mikhailov responds to and continues this attack on the nineteenth-century archive and its objectification of the historical process. Spieker considers archivally driven art in relation to changing media technologies--the typewriter, the telephone, the telegraph, film. And he connects the archive to a particularly modern visuality, showing that the avant-garde used the archive as something of a laboratory for experimental inquiries into the nature of vision and its relation to time. The Big Archive offers us the first critical monograph on an overarching motif in twentieth-century art.</p><h3>Review</h3><p>\"In this diligent and engaging study, Sven Spieker charts the hidden dimensions of the archive as both depository of actual material and the organizing fantasy and principle underwriting many of the West's bureaucratic and artistic practices.

Eighty years ago, desktops were equipped with a nonelectronic data processing machine: a card file. In Paper Machines, Markus Krajewski traces the evolution of this proto-computer of rearrangeable parts (file cards) that became ubiquitous in offices between the world wars. The story begins with Konrad Gessner, a sixteenth-century Swiss polymath who described a new method of processing data: to cut up a sheet of handwritten notes into slips of paper, with one fact or topic per slip, and arrange as desired. In the late eighteenth century, the card catalog became the librarian's answer to the threat of information overload. Then, at the turn of the twentieth century, business adopted the technology of the card catalog as a bookkeeping tool. Krajewski explores this conceptual development and casts the card file as a \"universal paper machine\" that accomplishes the basic operations of Turing's universal discrete machine: storing, processing, and transferring data. In telling his story, Krajewski takes the reader on a number of illuminating detours, telling us, for example, that the card catalog and the numbered street address emerged at the same time in the same city (Vienna), and that Harvard University's home-grown cataloging system grew out of a librarian's laziness; and that Melvil Dewey (originator of the Dewey Decimal System) helped bring about the technology transfer of card files to business.</p>", "languages": ["eng"], "cover_data": [null, null], "toc": null, "thumbnail": null, "db_id": null, "tags": ["PublicLibraryFestivalCollection", "TracingConcepts", "Library"], "timestamp": "2012-01-09 21:29:41+00:00", "last_modified": "2014-02-24 04:32:21+00:00", "mime": null, "authors": ["Markus Krajewski"], "format_metadata": {"PDF": {"path": "/home/m/devel/letssharebooks/mock2_calibre_library/Markus Krajewski/Paper Machines_ About Cards & Catalogs, 1548-1929 (49)/Paper Machines_ About Cards & Catalogs, 15 - Markus Krajewski.pdf", "size": 5703024, "mtime": "2014-02-24 04:32:21.200800+00:00"}, "MOBI": {"path": "/home/m/devel/letssharebooks/mock2_calibre_library/Markus Krajewski/Paper Machines_ About Cards & Catalogs, 1548-1929 (49)/Paper Machines_ About Cards & Catalogs, 15 - Markus Krajewski.mobi", "size": 2808880, "mtime": "2014-02-24 04:32:21.284800+00:00"}}, "publisher": "MIT", "series_index": null, "lpath": null, "user_categories": {}, "spine": null, "title_sort": "Paper Machines: About Cards & Catalogs, 1548-1929", "cover": null, "book_producer": null, "manifest": null, "formats": ["MOBI", "PDF"], "guide": null, "device_collections": [], "identifiers": {"google": "y3UwKT7ddPIC", "isbn": "9780262015899", "goodreads": "12829225"}}], "remove": []}, "librarian": "Jacqu3s Crosw3ll"};
