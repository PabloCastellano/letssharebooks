* try to use github download .zip through 'latest' tag
* check https://www.startssl.com/ for free ssl certificate
* add Sirkali Ramamrita Ranganathan, Lev Naumovich Tropovskii, Henri E. Bliss, Charles Ammi Cutter, Herbert Putnam, ??? Rusinov  to domain names.
* check subprocess.communicate and why it blocks sending message. it works if something else (a function) is called after it 
* check if calibre-server is installed 
* check if ssh login process is established
* make p2p infrastructure for sharing opds files with hashed additional info of jabber account who owns it + requests for books which should be sent by email or reminded in conference chat if requests for books and users are met
* add at the very beginning escape sequence to go up-left.
* add chatter to the end of public_key so the pair chatter-lsbuser can be easily traced. it should be added by lsbbot
* fucking arch python2
* from the logs: check the safe domains as once it suggested that private chat from conference is not safe domain.
* make list of safe jabber accounts out from safe domain
* check if running_slot can be better checked through ssh_proc 
* check if signal.SIGALRM can solve the timeout after free_slot_waiting for too long.
* check how selfdownloading test works on eth0 instead of wlan0
* rewrite MUCBot.message with some kind of event dispatcher style
* check if on disconnect of jabber user tunnels should be killed
* make reset_system for remote use
* make sure the only thing lsbapp sends about the system is its public key.. otherwise it can mess up with logic on server side
* check how i can make sure that someone else is not making clients and fucks everything up (someone with jabber account)
* check the JID of lsbbot on chatter side so that no one can cheat on starting conversation
* if different resource can't solve the problem than use the hook in candy chat for hiding everybody with name ending with __bot__ (and use that sufix for nick in lsbapp)
* make a timeout for free_slot_waiting so if not getting __got_the_slot__ in some time that lsbapp/chatter gets back to the beginning of conversation with lsbbot
* check if calibre can provide .zip file which can be easily used to import the book in another calibre
